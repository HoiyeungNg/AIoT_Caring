## For microbit:
Change the base url in rhub.py like 'http://192.168.43.156:8000/'
Link one microbit to laptop
Change the serial port listening on the laptop
and run rhub.py

## For backend:
Our database is deployed in the cloud, so there's no need to recreate it locally. However, access to the database is restricted to authorized IP addresses. To obtain access, please follow these steps:
1. Use this website http://ip4.me/ to obtain an IP address in the correct format.
2. Send us the address obtained in step one, and we will manually authorize it for access to the database in the cloud.
3. Once access has been authorized, you can begin using the database normally. Note that if the IP address changes, you will need to repeat this process to regain access.
